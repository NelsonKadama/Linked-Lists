# Linked-Lists

Question0.java
This program that creates a linked list. The program allows the user to key in input until
they decide to quit. 

Question1.java
Modifies the program developed in question 0 so much so that the user is able to delete/add nodes or
display the linked list until they decide to quit. The program outputs “deletion done!” for a
successful deletion or “Element not found” if the specified element is not found. Furthermore, the
program displays the elements of the list or output “List is empty” if there are no elements in
the list. In addition, the program prints “X is not a valid menu option” where X is any other
operation not supported by the menu as shown below.

Question2.java
With all the requirements to question1 met, the solution is enhanced to allow the user to specify where
in the list they wish to insert a new node if the list contains more than three elements. To do this,
the program prompts the user to enter the element after which they wish to do the insertion. If
the specified element is not found, the program adds the node at the back of the list as shown
below.

Question3.java
This program loads a text file into a linked list, sorts the lines based on increasing length and
then prints them to the screen with each line prefixed by the line number and number of non-space
characters in the line as shown in the sample output.
The name of the text file is supplied as the first command-line argument.

Question4.java
The program loads a text file into a linked list and print out its contents in reverse order (using
the formatting from Question 3).
The name of the text file is supplied as the first command-line parameter.
